LunarLander
===========

What is it?
-----------
Unity3D implementation of the game Lunar Lander. Roughly based off the tutorial provided by CgCookie: http://cgcookie.com/unity/2012/02/24/game-planning-lunar-lander-01/

Building the source code
------------
- Open Level1.unity with the free version of Unity 3D v4.x. Get the latest version of Unity 3D v4.x at http://unity3d.com/unity/download/archive

How to play
-----------
Use the arrow keys or the 2 large on screen buttons to navigate the craft from one landing pad to the next, turning the pads green as you go. You need to land the craft gently on the landing pads or it will explode.

- Fix toggle sounds on the main menu
- Add in-game Mini-map
