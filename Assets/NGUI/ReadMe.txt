Terms and Conditions
--------------------

You are welcome to use this version of NGUI for internal, evaluational and/or educational purposes only.

If you wish to distribute your own package with NGUI Free in it, please use the NGUI Distribution version
instead. You can download it here: http://www.tasharen.com/?page_id=140.

The contents of this package may not be used in commercial products outside of those distributed
as Unity Packages.

Due to how this package was set up, if you decide that NGUI is what you want to use for your project,
all your UIs will be transferrable to the full version of NGUI -- no data will be lost, provided you
will follow these simple upgrade steps:

While INSIDE of Unity:
- Delete the entire NGUI folder (first make sure your data is outside of it!)
- Import the unitypackage containing the full version of NGUI.

All your scripts, prefabs, scenes, etc will retain their references to NGUI components.
